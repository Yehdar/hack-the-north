// THE MINUTES — the Managing Partner's document.
//
// A real partner meeting ends with a written record: who was in the room, what
// each partner thought and whether they moved, where they disagreed, what was
// decided and on what conditions, and what happens next. A founder who only
// sees a score has to reconstruct all of that from a transcript.
//
// Pure: written from what the committee already said and decided, so it costs
// no model call, reads the same with or without a key, and can be rewritten
// after the pitch without re-running the room.
// ============================================================================
